TopGit - A different patch queue manager


DESCRIPTION
-----------

TopGit aims to make handling of large amount of interdependent topic
branches easier. In fact, it is designed especially for the case
when you maintain a queue of third-party patches on top of another
(perhaps Git-controlled) project and want to easily organize, maintain
and submit them - TopGit achieves that by keeping a separate topic
branch for each patch and providing few tools to maintain the branches.


RATIONALE
---------

Why not use something like StGIT or Guilt or rebase -i for maintaining
your patch queue?  The advantage of these tools is their simplicity;
they work with patch _series_ and defer to the reflog facility for
version control of patches (reordering of patches is not
version-controlled at all). But there are several disadvantages -
for one, these tools (especially StGIT) do not actually fit well
with plain Git at all: it is basically impossible to take advantage
of the index efectively when using StGIT. But more importantly,
these tools horribly fail in the face of distributed environment.

TopGit has been designed around three main tenets:

	(i) TopGit is as thin layer on top of Git as possible.
You still maintain your index and commit using Git, TopGit will
only automate few indispensable tasks.

	(ii) TopGit is anxious about _keeping_ your history. It will
never rewrite your history and all metadata is also tracked by Git,
smoothly and non-obnoxiously. It is good to have a _single_ point
when the history is cleaned up, and that is at the point of inclusion
in the upstream project; locally, you can see how your patch has evolved
and easily return to older versions.

	(iii) TopGit is specifically designed to work in distributed
environment. You can have several instances of TopGit-aware repositories
and smoothly keep them all up-to-date and transfer your changes between
them.

As mentioned above, the main intended use-case for TopGit is tracking
third-party patches, where each patch is effectively a single topic
branch.  In order to flexibly accomodate even complex scenarios when
you track many patches where many are independent but some depend
on others, TopGit ignores the ancient Quilt heritage of patch series
and instead allows the patches to freely form graphs (DAGs just like
Git history itself, only "one lever higher"). For now, you have
to manually specify which patches does the current one depend
on, but TopGit might help you with that in the future in a darcs-like
fashion.

A glossary plug: The union (i.e. merge) of patch dependencies is
called a _base_ of the patch (topic branch).

Of course, TopGit is perhaps not the right tool for you:

	(i) TopGit is not complicated, but StGIT et al. are somewhat
simpler, conceptually.  If you just want to make a linear purely-local
patch queue, deferring to StGIT instead might make more sense.

	(ii) When using TopGit, your history can get a little hairy
over time, especially with all the merges rippling through. ;-)

USAGE
-----

The 'tg' tool of TopGit has several subcommands:

tg help
~~~~~~~
	Our sophisticated integrated help facility. Doesn't do
	a whole lot for now.

tg create
~~~~~~~~~
	Create a new TopGit-controlled topic branch of a given name
	(required argument) and switch to it. If no dependencies
	are specified (by extra arguments passed after the first one),
	the current branch is assumed to be the only dependency.

	After `tg create`, you should insert the patch description
	to the '.topmsg' file, which will already contain some
	pre-filled bits. You can set topgit.to, topgit.cc and topgit.bcc
	configuration variables in order to have `tg create`
	add these headers with given default values to '.topmsg'.

	The main task of `tg create` is to set up the topic branch
	base from the dependencies. This may fail due to merge conflicts.
	In that case, after you commit the conflicts resolution,
	you should call `tg create` again (without any arguments);
	it will detect that you are on a topic branch base ref and
	resume the topic branch creation operation.

tg delete
~~~~~~~~~
	Remove a TopGit-controlled topic branch of given name
	(required argument). Normally, this command will remove
	only empty branch (base == head); use '-f' to remove
	non-empty branch.

	Currently, this command will _NOT_ remove the branch from
	the dependency list in other branches. You need to take
	care of this _manually_. This is even more complicated
	in combination with '-f', in that case you need to manually
	unmerge the removed branch's changes from the branches
	depending on it.

	TODO: '-a' to delete all empty branches, depfix, revert

tg info
~~~~~~~
	Show a summary information about the current or specified
	topic branch.

tg patch
~~~~~~~~
	Generate a patch from the current or specified topic branch.
	This means that the diff between the topic branch base and
	head (latest commit) is shown, appended to the description
	found in the .topmsg file.

	The patch is by default simply dumped to stdout. In the future,
	tg patch will be able to automatically send the patches by mail
	or save them to files. (TODO)

	TODO: tg patch -i to base at index instead of branch,
		-w for working tree

tg summary
~~~~~~~~~~
	Show overview of all TopGit-tracked topic branches and their
	up-to-date status ('0' marks that it introduces no own changes,
	'D' marks that it is out-of-date wrt. its dependencies,
	'!' marks that it has missing dependencies (even recursively),
	'B' marks that it is out-of-date wrt. its base).

	TODO: Speed up by an order of magnitude
	TODO: Graph view

tg update
~~~~~~~~~
	Update the current topic branch wrt. changes in the branches
	it depends on. This is made in two phases - first,
	changes within the dependencies are merged to the base,
	then the base is merged into the topic branch. The output
	will guide you in case of conflicts.

	In case your dependencies are not up-to-date, tg update
	will first recurse into them and update these.

	TODO: tg update -a for updating all topic branches

TODO: Some infrastructure for sharing topic branches between
	repositories easily
TODO: tg depend for adding/removing dependencies smoothly
TODO: tg collapse for creating a one-commit-per-patch tidied up
	history (for pulling by upstream)


IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

TopGit stores all the topic branches in the regular refs/heads/
namespace, (we recommend to mark them with the 't/' prefix).
Except that, TopGit also maintains a set of auxiliary refs in
refs/top-*. Currently, only refs/top-bases/ is used, containing
the current _base_ of the given topic branch - this is basically
a merge of all the branches the topic branch depends on; it is
updated during `tg update` and then merged to the topic branch,
and it is the base of a patch generated from the topic branch by
`tg patch`.

All the metadata is tracked within the source tree and history
of the topic branch itself, in .top* files; these files are kept
isolated within the topic branches during TopGit-controlled merges
and are of course omitted during `tg patch`. The state of these
files in base commits is undefined; look at them only in the topic
branches themselves.  Currently, two files are defined:

	.topmsg: Contains the description of the topic branch
in a mail-like format, plus the author information,
whatever Cc headers you choose or the post-three-dashes message.
When mailing out your patch, basically only few extra headers
mail headers are inserted and the patch itself is appended.
Thus, as your patches evolve, you can record nuances like whether
the paricular patch should have To-list/Cc-maintainer or vice
versa and similar nuances, if your project is into that.
From is prefilled from your current GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT, other headers
can be prefilled from various optional topgit.* config options.

	.topdeps: Contains the one-per-line list of branches
your patch depends on, pre-seeded with `tg create`. (Continuously
updated) merge of these branches will be the "base" of your topic
branch.

TopGit also automagically installs a bunch of custom commit-related
hooks that will verify if you are committing the .top* files in sane
state. It will add the hooks to separate files within the hooks/
subdirectory and merely insert calls of them to the appropriate hooks
and make them executable (but make sure the original hooks code
is not called if the hook was not executable beforehand).

Another automagically installed piece is .git/info/attributes specifier
for an 'ours' merge strategy for the files .topmsg and .topdeps, and
the (intuitive) 'ours' merge strategy definition in .git/config.
